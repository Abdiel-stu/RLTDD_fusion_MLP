# Multimodal deception detection in trial videos using intermediate fusion and interpretation methods
Intermediate fusion approach for [Real-life trial deception detection dataset](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/downloads.html#RealLifeDeception). The task is binary classification (truth:0 , lie: 1), using the Gated Multimodal Unit ([GMU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01992)) and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation ([LRP](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130140)) to explore learned patterns.
